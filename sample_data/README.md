## Detailed EEG Data Structure

- **Data Format**: 
  - Each row in the CSV file represents one epoch.
  - An epoch consists of 16 samples from each of the 8 EEG channels, captured simultaneously over 62.5ms.

- **Columns**: 
  - Each column is labeled to reflect the specific EEG channel and the sample number within that epoch.
  - For instance, if there are 8 channels and each channel has 16 samples per epoch, the columns would be named as:
    - 'CP3_sample1', 'CP3_sample2', ..., 'CP3_sample16',
    - 'C3_sample1', 'C3_sample2', ..., 'C3_sample16',
    - ..., 
    - 'CP4_sample1', 'CP4_sample2', ..., 'CP4_sample16'.
  - This results in 128 EEG data columns (8 channels x 16 samples each).

- **Rows**: 
  - Each row contains all the samples from all channels for a single epoch.
  - The data in the columns are ordered such that all samples from one channel are listed before moving to the next channel.

- **Metadata**:
  - Additional metadata columns may include 'epoch_timestamp', 'label', etc., which are crucial for analysis and are placed at the beginning or end of each row.

## Benefits for Machine Learning
- This structured format is highly beneficial for machine learning and time-series analysis:
  - It ensures that all data from one time point (epoch) are aligned in a single row, facilitating algorithms that analyze temporal dynamics across multiple channels simultaneously.
