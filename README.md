# MKEDS: Multi-Kinesis Event Detection System

MKEDS is a modular and efficient system for detecting multiple kinesis events simultaneously using EEG data. It leverages the Neurosity SDK to collect raw EEG data, preprocess it, train a machine learning model, and perform real-time inference. The system is designed to be modular, maintainable, and extensible.
